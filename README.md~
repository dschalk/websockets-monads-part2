#Websockets Monads

This is the third page in the "Javascript Monads" series. "Fun With Monads" and Websockets Monads preceeded it. 

In this installment, the front-end developer gets a glimpse of what it is like to have a control panel which determines the flow of the entire application. In one monad tree, MonadIter instances and the next function resolve sequential operations on four random numbers and assign one point if the result of "20" is achieved and three points if the result is "18". 

This demonstration will soon be third on the list at [http://schalk.net](http://schalk.net). The client is based on snabbdom. The server is a modified Haskell Wai-Websockets server. If you clone this repository and enter:
```
cd websockets-monads-part2
dist/build/server/server
```
the running app should appear at localhost:3093.
