# Javascript Animation Monads
 
This is the fourth page in the `Javascript Monads` series. `Fun With Monads`, `Websockets Monads`, and `Websockets Monads Part 2` preceeded it. The `bnd` method changed after the second page. It no longer takes the calling monad's value as a parameter. 

The project's running code is at [http://schalk.net](http://schalk.net). You can run the binary on port 3093 by entering `dist/build/server/server`.
