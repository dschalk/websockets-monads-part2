#Websockets Monads

This is the third page in the "Javascript Monads" series. Fun With Monads and Websockets Monads preceeded it.

The online demonstration is running online, and is available  at [http://schalk.net](http://schalk.net). The client is based on snabbdom. The server is a modified Haskell Wai-Websockets server. If you clone this repository and enter:
```
cd websockets-monads-part2
dist/build/server/server
```
the running app should appear at localhost:4002.
